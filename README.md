# ColesLawnCare

This was a project I made for two of my friends who have their own lawn care service. They were not looking for anything "flashy" so this is a pretty basic layout,
but it displays good use of modular React coding and the use of Vite, TailwindCSS, and React.


I designed this website so that it would be easily updated by someone without a large amount of developing experience. The content on the website is handled by
constants which can be added to, removed, or edited.
